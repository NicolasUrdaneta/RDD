\item This table contains egression discontinuity based estimates of                   the effect of having BAC above the DUI threshold on recidivism.                   Panel A contains estimates with a bandwidth of 0.05 while Panel B                   has a bandwidth of 0.025, with all regressions utilizing a rectangular                   kernel for weighting. Controls include indicators for year, race,                    gender, and age of the offender (not county).                    Robust standard errors in parenthesis.                    * p$<$0.10, ** p$<$0.05, *** p$<$0.01
